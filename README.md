# VerySoBot
Discord bot proxy for Keybase, initially created for NotSoBot.

# Usage
With docker:
```
$ cp example.env .env
$ docker run --env-file=.env fogapod/verysobot
```

# TODO
- Restricted mode support (restricted bots on keybase)
- Parallel processing of commands with multiple channels
- Better support for commands
- Better attachments support
- Support for other platforms than keybase?
